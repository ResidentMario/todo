## To Do

Two versions of the the fabled to-do application, one in React and one in React/Redux. Made for practice.

To build the React version run `npm run-script build-react`.

To build the React/Redux version run `npm run-script build-react-redux`.

Twiddle the `src` in the `script` tag in `index.html` to point to either `dist/index-react.js` or `dist/index-react-redux.js`, depending on which one you want.

Then open `index.html` in something that can serve it. `npx http-server .` for example.
